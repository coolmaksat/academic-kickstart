AberOWL is a framework for ontology-based access to biological
data. It consists of a repository of bio-ontologies, a set of
webservices which provide access to OWL(-EL) reasoning over the
ontologies, and several frontends which utilise the ontology
repository and reasoning services to provide access to specific
biological datasets.
