Knowledge obtained from tomato researchinitiated improvements in tomato and, beingtransferrable to other such economically importantcrops, has led to a surge of tomato-related researchand published literature. We developed DES-TOMATOknowledgebase (KB) for exploration of informationrelated to tomato. Information exploration isenabled through terms from 26 dictionaries andcombination of these terms. To illustrate theutility of DES-TOMATO, we provide several exampleshow one can efficiently use this KB to retrieveknown or potentially novel information.
